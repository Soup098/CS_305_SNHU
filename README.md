Repo for Software Security course

I have been using this repo to maintain the majority of my course work throughout the course.

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
 
  -The client, Artemis financial, is a financial institution that needed a solution to maintaining secure transactions both foreign and domestic.
  
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

  -I found the dependancy checker tool to be particularly interesting and fun to use. It was cool to go through and learn what all of the errors were and how to deal with them coding securely is paramaount as it makes both you and your clients   able to have confidence that there data will not be breached, and they can work together toward a secure application execution.
  
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  -It was just a lot of reading and trying to understand what the different parts of the assessment meant.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  -Adding checksum verification, generating certificates and adding layers of varification within the codebase
  
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  -I did struggle to get my code to execute during this class, and further learning is required for me to figure out where i went wrong. 
  
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  -The book assigned for the class was out of date, but still full of some relevent information and useful. Also, the book "Web Application Security" second edition(2024) by Andrew Hoffman was a good read
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  -I likely would showcase my certificate generation, and my dependancy checking assignments
